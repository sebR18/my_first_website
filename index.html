                <p>I am a Junior Computer Science Major in search of an internship. JAVA is my go to coding language,
                    but I have experience with C/C++, HTML, Javascript, CSS, Node.js, and more, and am always yearning
                    to learn more and try new things. I have a passion for making the world a better place for our
                    future
                    and I want to create a lasting impact on the field as it relates to improving the human experience.

                            <p>I didn't choose to be born in Colombia, I just got lucky. All jokes aside, I am born in
                                Colombia and so is my whole family. We immigrated to the states back in 97' when I was
                                just
                                a wee boy about to turn 3 years old, so Im basically from Seattle, Washingotn. That
                                being said,
                                my parents have made sure that the culture runs deep in my blood and I love them for it.
                                I've
                                visited my homeland only one time as soon as we got our legal residancy in line. Only
                                once cause
                                it was all we could afford. The culture is amazing, the people are extremely nice, and
                                the food
                                is finger-lickin-good!!

                            <p>Now you know I grew up in Seattle. Seattle is everything to me. Its where my friends and
                                family are,
                                where I found the love of my life, and where I became who I am today. It's truly a
                                beautiful, almost
                                perfect place to be.(Cost of living is getting worse!) I would never leave this city if
                                it weren't
                                for getting a higher education which is why I am currently in San Diego majoring in
                                Computer Science
                                at the University of San Diego. I'll be finishing my degree in May of 2020! HIP HIP
                                HOORAY!
