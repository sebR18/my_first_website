                <p>>My name is Jhoan Sebastian Ramirez, I'm a proud, first-generation, college graduate
                    from a loving Colombian, immigrant, family, and I am writing this letter as a genuine
                    reflection of my spiritual enlightenment journey thus far. My life began in the heart
                    of Colombia in a city called Cali. We immigrated to the U.S. before I was two years
                    old so I wish I could tell you more, but my family made sure I would not forget our 
                    roots. I was born to two loving and caring parents who have guided me in a way I hope
                    to guide my own children someday. One and a half years after I was born, in the hopes
                    of giving my siblings and me a better opportunity, our parents gave up everything they
                    had and took our lives to the United States. With the help of a couple of aunts living
                    in Bellevue, Washington they had places to stay while they got accustomed to the 
                    completely new way of life. I have heard stories, but can only imagen the culture
                    shock they must have felt. As for me, because my life was, pretty much, just beginning,
                    my culture became a mix of both worlds.

                            <p> As a first-generation college graduate, I have established an exceptional track record 
                                in the successful accomplishment of the rigorous Computer Science program at the University
                                of San Diego, Shiley-Marcos School of Engineering. This remarkable work ethic originated early
                                on in my childhood and I have since developed an immense eagerness for challenges 
                                and a strong sense of pride in the quality of my work. Overtime, I have focused my attention
                                on my great passion for new and enhanced technologies due to my deep belief in the ability
                                of this field to revolutionize the human experience beyond our imagination, for generations
                                to come. I have experience and course work in a broad range of computer-science topics from 
                                Java and C/C++ to Object-Oriented-Design, Data Structures and Algorithms where I have developed
                                a deep understanding of computational theory and its practical applications in the field.

                            <p>Now you know I grew up in Seattle. Seattle is everything to me. Its where my friends and
                                family are,
                                where I found the love of my life, and where I became who I am today. It's truly a
                                beautiful, almost
                                perfect place to be. Though the cost of living can be upsetting :( I would never leave this city if
                                it weren't for getting a higher education which is why I am currently in San Diego majoring in
                                Computer Science
                                at the University of San Diego. I'll be finishing my degree in May of 2020! HIP HIP
                                HOORAY!
