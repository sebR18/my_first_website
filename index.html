                <p>
                    My name is Jhoan Sebastian Ramirez, I am a first-generation college graduate who established 
                    an exceptional track record in the successful accomplishment of the rigorous Computer Science program at the University
                    of San Diego, Shiley-Marcos School of Engineering. This remarkable work ethic originated early
                    on in my childhood and I have since developed an immense eagerness for challenges 
                    and a strong sense of pride in the quality of my work. Overtime, I have focused my attention
                    on my great passion for new and enhanced technologies due to my deep belief in the ability
                    of this field to revolutionize the human experience beyond our imagination, for generations
                    to come. I have experience and course work in a broad range of computer-science topics from 
                    Java and C/C++ to Object-Oriented-Design, Data Structures and Algorithms where I have developed
                    a deep understanding of computational theory and its practical applications in the field.

                            <p> 
                                I'm a proud, first-generation, college graduate
                                from a loving Colombian, immigrant, family. My life began in the heart
                                of Colombia in a city called Cali. We immigrated to the U.S. before I was two years
                                old so I wish I could tell you more, but my family made sure I would not forget our 
                                roots. I was born to two loving and caring parents who have guided me in a way I hope
                                to guide my own children someday. One and a half years after I was born, in the hopes
                                of giving my siblings and me a better opportunity, our parents gave up everything they
                                had and took our lives to the United States, Bellevue, Washington to be exact. 
                                With the help of a couple of aunts living
                                in Bellevue we had places to stay while we got accustomed to the 
                                completely new way of life. I have heard stories, but can only imagen the culture
                                shock they must have felt. As for me, because my life was, pretty much, just beginning, and
                                my culture became a mix of both worlds.

                            <p>Now you know I grew up in Seattle. Seattle is everything to me. Its where my friends and
                                family are,
                                where I found the love of my life, and where I became who I am today. It's truly a
                                beautiful, almost
                                perfect place to be. Though the cost of living can be upsetting, I would never leave this city if
                                it weren't for getting a higher education, but I JUST GRADUATED ON MAY 24TH, 2020!!! =D Now its time 
                                for me to move back home, GET TO WORK!:), and be with family.
